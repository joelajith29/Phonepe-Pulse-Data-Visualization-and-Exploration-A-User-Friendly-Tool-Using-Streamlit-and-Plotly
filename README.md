# Phonepe-Pulse-Data-Visualization-and-Exploration-A-User-Friendly-Tool-Using-Streamlit-and-Plotly

Phonepe-Pulse-Data-Visualization project is all about in short cloning the data from github repository and utilising the data for visualisation for betterunderstanding of users. In this project i have utilised the below tools to arrive at the result. they are Pulse data cloning by using the code !git clone https://github.com/PhonePe/pulse.git Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a popular code editor developed by Microsoft and it's well-suited for Python development due to its flexibility, extensive extensions, and powerful features.It is used to create a .py file which alone will be supported by streamlit MySQL is an open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that is widely used for managing structured data. It's developed, distributed, and supported by Oracle Corporation.It is used to upload my dataframe into database ,which is later used for visualization Plotly is a popular open-source data visualization library that provides a platform for creating interactive and publication-quality graphs and charts. It supports several programming languages including Python, R, and JavaScript, allowing users to create a wide range of visualizations for data analysis, exploration, and presentation purposes. Choropleth maps in Plotly refer to geographical visualizations where regions are shaded or patterned in proportion to a statistical variable, such as population density, income levels, or any other numeric value associated with specific geographical areas. Plotly provides functionalities to create interactive choropleth maps using its Python library. Streamlit is an open-source Python library used for building web applications for data science and machine learning projects. It simplifies the process of creating interactive and customizable web apps by allowing developers to convert Python scripts into shareable web apps quickly. these tools helps me to bring out the desired result
